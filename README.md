## After having all the necessary softwares and libraries:
1. Open Netbeans IDE, and open project folder submitted in this assignment in the IDE.
2. Download provided JARs and import one by one by going to the Libraries folder in the Projects section present at the left side of the IDE.
3. Right click on the Libraries folder, click Add Jar/Folder, and choose the relevant JAR file from your directory and finally click on Choose button.
4. Do the above step one by one for all the necessary JAR files.
5. Ensure that JDK 1.8 is selected by the Netbeans. This can be checked by going
to the Java Platforms in the Tools section present in the IDEâ€™s menu bar.
6. AddplatformasJDK1.8andclickonClose.
7. Open XAMPP and click on StartAll to start all the servers.
8. Go to this link: http://localhost/phpmyadmin/index.php and create a new database named hotel.
9. Import the database hotel.sql attached in the zip for this assignment. This would import one table 'room' in the database.

After having the setup, it's time to run the application.

Click on the Run Project button (Green play button) located at the top of the IDE.
